# Semantic_Segmentation
Implementation of model in which mobilenet as encoder and Unet as decoder.

Abstract:
Image segmentation is a key topic in image processing and computer vision with applications such as scene understanding, medical image analysis, robotic perception, video surveillance, augmented reality, and image compression, among many others. Various algorithms for image segmentation have been developed. Recently, due to the success of deep learning models in a wide range of vision applications, there has been a substantial amount of works aimed at developing image segmentation approaches using deep learning models. Pixel-wise image segmentation is a well-studied problem in computer vision. The task of semantic image segmentation is to classify each pixel in the image. Semantic image segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image from a predefined set of classes. In this project the UNET model is used for scene parsing. Scene parsing, based on semantic segmentation, is a fundamental topic in computer vision. The goal is to assign each pixel in the image a category label. Scene parsing provides complete understanding of the scene.

Majorly sky with sky-blue color, vegetation with green color, vehicle as pink color and road as violet color

As the model is trained on roadscene dataset the test images is from Indian Driving dataset.
